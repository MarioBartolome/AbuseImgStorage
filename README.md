# AbuseImgStorage

- To fragment a file into "images" ;)

`user@computer ~/AbuseImgStorage/FileComposer> python3 Fragmentor.py FILE_PATH_TO_FILE`

It will create 2-5MB chunks, that will display a small image (to avoid overloading too much). Also, and this is 
**important**, it will generate a ``.db`` file. **KEEP IT**. This file is needed to reconstruct the original from the 
chunks.


- To reconstruct the original file from the pieces: 

Make sure **the `.db` file is in the same folder as the pieces**. 
Also, on this very first version, the names of the pieces should be the same as the ones created during the 
fragmentation process. 

`user@computer ~/AbuseImgStorage/FileComposer> python3 Fragmentor.py FILE_PATH_TO_DB`

It will recreate the original file the chunks were made from.


- To check the integrity of the reconstructed files: 

If you have both files, the original and the reconstructed one, and want to check if they're really
the same, you can do it: 

`user@computer ~/AbuseImgStorage/FileComposer> python3 Fragmentor.py FILE_PATH_TO_ORIGINAL FILE_PATH_TO_RECONSTRUCTED`


Use it at your own discretion.
